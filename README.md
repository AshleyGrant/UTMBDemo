## UTMB Demo

Demo repo to demonstrate Git branching strategy and Azure DevOps solution for not using deployment pipelines and semi-automate pushing code to Development, UAT, and Production branches as well as "deploying" artifacts (simulated by creating a zip file artifact).

This repo contains a CSV file with a list of US counties and data regarding them. This data is not expected to be correct, as it will be changed for demo purposes without regard for data accuracy.
